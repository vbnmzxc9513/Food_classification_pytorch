# Food_classification_pytorch
## Introduction
- An easy images classification CNN deep learning example. 
- If the folder location is the same as the Github configuration, there is no need to readjust the path.

## Quick Start
- pip install torch torchvision
- Open the .ipynb and start.
###  if you also want to know the each model complexity detail, install flowing package.
- pip install thop
- pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/sovrasov/flops-counter.pytorch.git


### To understand the parameters and MOCs used in torchvision pretrained model, easy way calculate MACs and parameter by Thop.
